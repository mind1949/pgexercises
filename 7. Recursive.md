## Intro
> Common Table Expressions allow us to, effectively, create our own temporary tables for the duration of a query - they're largely a convenience to help us make more readable SQL. Using the [WITH RECURSIVE](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-with.html) modifier, however, it's possible for us to create recursive queries. This is enormously advantageous for working with tree and graph-structured data - imagine retrieving all of the relations of a graph node to a given depth, for example.
This category shows you some basic recursive queries that are possible using our dataset.

## Q1: find the upward recommendation chain for member ID 27

> Find the upward recommendation chain for member ID 27: that is, the member who recommended them, and the member who recommended that member, and so on. Return member ID, first name, and surname. Order by descending member id.

```sql
-- with recursive 递归查询
with recursive recommenders as (
  select memid as recommender, firstname, surname, recommendedby
  	from cd.members where memid = 27
  union
  	select m.memid, m.firstname, m.surname, m.recommendedby
  		from cd.members as m, recommenders -- 原始表格与递归的表格都要有
  		where m.memid = recommenders.recommendedby -- 指定递归条件
  )
 select recommender, firstname, surname
 	from recommenders
	where recommender != 27
order by recommender desc
```

## Q2: find the downward recommendation chain for member ID 1

> Find the downward recommendation chain for member ID 1: that is, the members they recommended, the members those members recommended, and so on. Return member ID and name, and order by ascending member id.

```sql
with recursive recommenders as (
  select memid, firstname, surname, recommendedby
  	from cd.members
  	where memid = 1
  union
  	select m.memid, m.firstname, m.surname, m.recommendedby
  		from cd.members as m, recommenders
  		where m.recommendedby = recommenders.memid -- 倒序的递归条件
  )
select memid, firstname, surname
	from recommenders
	where memid != 1
order by memid;
```
**解析**
>正序递归与倒序递归的区别是递归条件的不同

## Q3: produce a CTE that can return the upward recommendation chain for any member 

> Produce a CTE that can return the upward recommendation chain for any member. You should be able to select recommender from recommenders where member=x. Demonstrate it by getting the chains for members 12 and 22. Results table should have member and recommender, ordered by member ascending, recommender descending.

```sql
-- 这个答案是标准答案 , 但我感觉不好, 不清晰
with recursive recommenders(recommender, member) as (
	select recommendedby, memid
		from cd.members
	union all
	select mems.recommendedby, recs.member
		from recommenders recs
		inner join cd.members mems
			on mems.memid = recs.recommender
)
select recs.member member, recs.recommender, mems.firstname, mems.surname
	from recommenders recs
	inner join cd.members mems		
		on recs.recommender = mems.memid
	where recs.member = 22 or recs.member = 12
order by recs.member asc, recs.recommender desc 
```
