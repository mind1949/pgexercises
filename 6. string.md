## Intro
> String operations in most RDBMSs are, arguably, needlessly painful. Fortunately, Postgres is better than most in this regard, providing strong regular expression support. This section covers basic string manipulation, use of the LIKE operator, and use of regular expressions. I also make an effort to show you some alternative approaches that work reliably in most RDBMSs. Be sure to check out Postgres' string function [docs page](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-matching.html) if you're not confident about these exercises.
Anthony Molinaro's SQL Cookbook provides some excellent documentation of (difficult) cross-DBMS compliant SQL string manipulation. I'd strongly recommend his book, particularly as it's published by O'Reilly, whose ethical policy of DRM-free ebook distribution deserves rich rewards.

## Q1: formate the name of members

> Output the names of all members, formatted as 'Surname, Firstname'

```sql
select surname || ', ' || firstname as name
	from cd.members
```

## Q2: find facilities by a name prefix

> Find all facilities whose name begins with 'Tennis'. Retrieve all columns.

```sql
select *
	from cd.facilities
	where name like 'Tennis%'
```

## Q3: perform a case-insensitive search

> Perform a case-insensitive search to find all facilities whose name begins with 'tennis'. Retrieve all columns.

```sql
select *
	from cd.facilities
	where upper(name) like 'TENNIS%';
```

## Q4: find telephone numbers with parentheses

> You've noticed that the club's member table has telephone numbers with very inconsistent formatting. You'd like to find all the telephone numbers that contain parentheses, returning the member ID and telephone number sorted by member ID.

```sql
select memid, telephone
	from cd.members
	where telephone like '(%)%';
```
## Q5: pad zip codes with leading zeroes

> The zip codes in our example dataset have had leading zeroes removed from them by virtue of being stored as a numeric type. Retrieve all zip codes from the members table, padding any zip codes less than 5 characters long with leading zeroes. Order by the new zip code.

```sql
select lpad(cast(zipcode as char(5)),5, '0') zip from cd.members order by zip  
```
