## Intro
> This category deals primarily with a foundational concept in relational database systems: joining. Joining allows you to combine related information from multiple tables to answer a question. This isn't just beneficial for ease of querying: a lack of join capability encourages denormalisation of data, which increases the complexity of keeping your data internally consistent.
This topic covers inner, outer, and self joins, as well as spending a little time on subqueries (queries within queries). If you struggle with these questions, I strongly recommend [Learning SQL](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007270.do), by Alan Beaulieu, as a concise and well-written book on the subject.

## Q1: retrive start times of members bookings

> How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named 'David Farrell'?

```sql
select b.starttime
	from cd.bookings as b 
		inner join cd.members as m
			on b.memid = m.memid 
				and m.firstname = 'David'
				and m.surname = 'Farrell';

/*or*/
select bks.starttime 
	from 
		cd.bookings bks
		inner join cd.members mems
			on mems.memid = bks.memid
	where 
		mems.firstname='David' 
		and mems.surname='Farrell'; 
```
## Q2:  Work out the start times of bookings for tennis courts

> How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, for the date '2012-09-21'? Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.

```sql
select b.starttime as start, f.name
	from
		cd.facilities as f
		inner join cd.bookings as b
			on b.facid = f.facid
	where f.name like 'Tennis Court _' and
		b.starttime between '2012-09-21' and '2012-09-22'
order by b.starttime;
```

## Q3: Produce a list of all members who have recommended another member

> How can you output a list of all members who have recommended another member? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).

```sql
select distinct m1.firstname, m1.surname -- distinct 表示行不同,而不是列不同
	from cd.members as m1
		inner join cd.members as m2
			on m2.recommendedby = m1.memid
	where not m2.recommendedby is null
order by surname, firstname;
```

## Q4: Produce a list of all members, along with their recommender

> How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any)? Ensure that results are ordered by (surname, firstname). 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19871320/59081559-5a189f80-8921-11e9-93a7-47fb67caf0c5.png)

```sql
select m1.firstname as memfname,
		m1.surname as memsname,
		m2.firstname as recfname,
		m2.surname as recsname
	from cd.members as m1
		left outer join cd.members as m2
			on m2.memid = m1.recommendedby
order by m1.surname, m1.firstname;
```
## Q5: produce a list of members who have used tennis course

> How can you produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court? Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by the member name.

```sql
select distinct (m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname) as member,
		f.name as facility
	from cd.members as m
		inner join cd.bookings as b
			on m.memid = b.memid
		inner join cd.facilities as f
			on b.facid = f.facid
	where f.name like 'Tennis%'
order by member -- 别名可以在任何地方使用, 排序也不例外
```
## Q6: Produce a list of costly bookings

> How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19871320/59082811-5a1b9e00-8927-11e9-8bca-9df433e8738f.png)

```sql
select m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname as member,
		f.name as facility,
		case
			when m.memid = 0 then
				b.slots*f.guestcost
			else
				b.slots*f.membercost
		end as cost
	from
		cd.members as m
		inner join cd.bookings as b
			on m.memid = b.memid
		inner join cd.facilities as f
			on b.facid = f.facid
	where 
		b.starttime between '2012-09-14' and '2012-09-15'
		and (
			m.memid = 0 and b.slots*f.guestcost > 30
		  	or
		  	m.memid != 0 and b.slots*f.membercost > 30
		)
order by cost desc;
```
## Q7: produce a list of all members, along with their recommender(if any), using no join

> How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname pairing is formatted as a column and ordered. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19871320/59140279-1039c300-89ce-11e9-94e2-c67148b06f3e.png)

```sql
-- 使用子查询可以进行where过滤,也可以填充计算字段
-- 这道题是填充计算字段
select distinct m1.firstname || ' ' || m1.surname as member,
	(select m2.firstname || ' ' || m2.surname 
	  	from cd.members as m2
	  	where m2.memid = m1.recommendedby
	) as recommender
	from 
		cd.members as m1
order by member;

/*or*/
select distinct mems.firstname || ' ' ||  mems.surname as member,
	(select recs.firstname || ' ' || recs.surname as recommender 
		from cd.members recs 
		where recs.memid = mems.recommendedby
	)
	from 
		cd.members mems
order by member;
```

## Q8:  Produce a list of costly bookings, using a subquery

> The Produce a list of costly bookings exercise contained some messy logic: we had to calculate the booking cost in both the WHERE clause and the CASE statement. Try to simplify this calculation using subqueries. For reference, the question was:

How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by descending cost.

```sql
select member, facility, cost
	from (
	  select m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname as member,
	  		f.name as facility,
	  		case
	  			when f.facid = 0 then
	  				b.slots*f.guestcost
	  			else
	  				b.slots*f.membercost
	  		end as cost
	 		from
	  			cd.members as m
	  			inner join cd.bookings as b
	  				on m.memid = b.memid
	  			inner join cd.facilities as f
	  				on b.facid = f.facid
	  		where
	  			b.starttime between '2012-09-14' and '2012-09-15' -- 这里不能有分号
	 ) as bookings -- 这里必须起一个别名
	where cost > 30 -- 使用内部的查询简化了外部查询的where子句
order by cost desc;
```
